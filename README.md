# DungeonAuraTools
Dungeon Aura Tools dynamicly creates Dungeon WeakAuras based on user selections to indicate buffs, debuffs, casts and other relevant information.

 

Supports all important spells for Trash/Bosses (some casts get spammed by mobs so those are not tracked since they would create too much disturbance even though they might be important) aswell as Dungeon/Covenant specific stuff and some M+ Affixes.

 

Quick Start:
To open the options window, type /jdt or /DungeonAuraTools into your chat and hit enter.

 

Options for Changing your Auras when they were generated:

Icon width and height
showing Timers and hiding cooldown Spinners
Choosing the fonts and text size
enable or disable sounds
X and Y- offset of the groups
Limit the amount of Auras showing at any given time
Grow directions and other grow related options
Anchroing Auras to the Affix group.

Ofcourse you can always manually adjust the settings on  a per Aura level via the normal WeakAuras options!
